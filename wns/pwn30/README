This is an LMF file for Princeton Wordnet 3.0, made using the new LMF
file by John MacCrae

$ wget http://john.mccr.ae/wn30.xml

I made some changes to the metadata:

license="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-commercial-use"
citation="Christiane Fellbaum. (ed.) (1998) *WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database*, MIT Press"
confidenceScore="1.0"

Because the file is so big, we store it compressed.
